    "INI-style files, short for Initialization files, are a simple and widely used file format for configuration and data storage. They are named after the filename extension \".ini\" commonly associated with these files. INI files are text-based and consist of sections, keys, and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic characteristics of INI-style files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sections:** INI files are divided into sections, each marked by a header enclosed in square brackets. Sections help organize settings into logical groups. For example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   [Section1]\n",
    "   key1 = value1\n",
    "   key2 = value2\n",
    "\n",
    "   [Section2]\n",
    "   key3 = value3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keys and Values:** Within each section, there are key-value pairs where the key and value are separated by an equal sign (=). For example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   [Database]\n",
    "   host = localhost\n",
    "   port = 3306\n",
    "   username = admin\n",
    "   password = secret\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comments:** Comments in INI files are preceded by a semicolon (;) or a hash (#). Comments are ignored by applications reading the file.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ; This is a comment\n",
    "   [Section]\n",
    "   key = value  # Another comment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Whitespace:** Whitespace (spaces or tabs) is generally allowed and ignored, but it's common to follow a specific indentation or alignment convention for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "INI files are easy to read and edit manually, making them a popular choice for configuration files in various software applications. They are supported by many programming languages and frameworks. However, they lack some features found in more modern configuration file formats, such as nested structures and data types. For more complex scenarios, alternative formats like JSON, YAML, or XML might be preferred."
